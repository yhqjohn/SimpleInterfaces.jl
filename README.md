# SimpleInterfaces.jl

A lightweight, non-intrusive interface system for Julia that provides compile-time contract verification for multi-type interactions.

## Development Status (Current Work)

This package is currently under active development. The core functionality is stable, and the first stage goals are met. 

### Future Plans

**Interface Implementation Methods**: We plan to add support for built-in method/function templates within interface definitions. These templates would provide default implementations for type compositions that implement the interface. When `@impls` or `@assertimpls` is called at module top-level, these template methods would be automatically instantiated for the specific type composition, reducing boilerplate code and ensuring consistent implementations across different types.

## Philosophy & Design

This interface system treats an interface as a **compile-time verifiable contract** on a **set of types**. The design embraces Julia's multiple dispatch paradigm while providing static verification capabilities. The key principles are:

1.  **Interfaces as Multi-Type Contracts**: An interface can specify requirements across several interacting types (e.g., a container, its elements, and its index type).
2.  **Implicit Implementation**: A set of types implements an interface simply by satisfying its requirements. No explicit `MyType <: MyInterface` is needed.
3.  **Explicit, Zero-Cost Checking**: Verification is done explicitly via macros, but this check happens entirely at compile-time, incurring **zero runtime cost**.

## A Comprehensive Example

This example demonstrates the core features of `SimpleInterfaces.jl`. We define a `ReadableCollection` interface for a container `C` that holds elements of type `E` and is indexed by keys of type `I`.

### 1. Defining the Interface

```julia
@interface ReadableCollection C, E, I<:Integer begin
    # 1. Covariant Field Requirement:
    # The container `C` must have a field `data` that is a subtype of
    # `AbstractArray{E, 1}`. An implementation using `Vector{E}` (which is a
    # subtype) will satisfy this.
    C.data::AbstractArray{E, 1}

    # 2. Field Existence Requirement:
    # It must have a field named `metadata` (type not specified).
    C.metadata

    # 3. Method with Covariant Return Type:
    # It must have a `length` method that returns a subtype of `Integer`.
    function Base.length(::C)::Integer end

    # 4. Multi-Type Method Requirement:
    # It must have a `getindex` method for the specific pair (C, I)
    # that returns an element of type `E`.
    function Base.getindex(::C, ::I)::E end
end
```

### 2. Checking the Interface

```julia
using SimpleInterfaces

# A struct that correctly implements the interface
struct MyCollection{T}
    data::Vector{T} # Vector{T} <: AbstractArray{T, 1} (Covariance)
    metadata::Any
end
Base.length(c::MyCollection)::Int = length(c.data) # Int <: Integer (Covariance)
Base.getindex(c::MyCollection{T}, i::Int)::T where {T} = c.data[i]

# This check passes because all constraints are met.
@assertimpls MyCollection{String}, String, Int, ReadableCollection
```

## Interface Inheritance & Composition: The `@impls` Macro

Interface composition allows building complex interfaces from simpler ones. The design uses explicit `@impls` declarations within interface definitions, which provides clear semantics and avoids confusion with Julia's type inheritance system.

### Design Rationale

Why not use `<:` syntax for composition? Because composition represents a different semantic relationship. When we write `@interface CanFooBar I, J, K begin ... end`, the types `I, J, K` are the **type composition** that implements the interface, not the interface itself being parameterized. Using `<:` would suggest that `CanFooBar{I, J, K}` is an instance of some parent interface, which is semantically incorrectâ€”the composition `(I, J, K)` itself is what implements `CanFooBar`.

The `@impls` syntax maintains consistency with how we list different forms of requirements within an interface body, making the inheritance relationship explicit and unambiguous.

### Defining a Composite Interface

Let's say we have two simple interfaces, `CanFoo` and `CanBar`:
```julia
@interface CanFoo X, Y begin
    function foo(::X, ::Y)::Bool end
end

@interface CanBar Z begin
    function bar(::Z)::String end
end
```

We can define a new interface, `CanFooBar`, that requires a type composition to satisfy both:
```julia
@interface CanFooBar I, J, K begin
    # This says: "The first two type variables (I, J) of CanFooBar
    # must implement CanFoo."
    @impls I, J CanFoo

    # This says: "The first type variable (I) of CanFooBar must implement CanBar."
    @impls I CanBar

    # CanFooBar can also add its own requirements.
    function baz(::I, ::K)::Int end
end
```
The `@impls` macro maps the type variables of the child interface to the required parent interface. The mapping is positional: `I` maps to `CanFoo`'s `X`, and `J` maps to `Y`.

You can also map concrete types:
```julia
@interface CanFooWithInt J begin
    # This requires that the type composition (J, Int) implements `CanFoo`.
    @impls J, Int CanFoo
end
```

### Checking a Composite Interface

Checking an implementation recursively verifies all requirements from parent interfaces plus the new requirements from the child interface itself:
```julia
@assertimpls MyType, YourType, TheirType CanFooBar
```
The system ensures that if there's a failure, the earliest error in the inheritance chain is reported, helping you pinpoint the root cause quickly.

## Advanced Topic: Covariance and Contravariance

*(This is an advanced topic for users interested in the design details.)*

A key design choice in this library is how we handle subtyping in method requirements. In Julia's type system, function arguments are **contravariant**. This means that if you have a function `f(x::SuperType)`, it can be considered a "subtype" of a more specific function `f(x::SubType)`.

However, for an interface contract, this behavior is often the reverse of what a user expects. If an interface requires a method that can handle *any* `Integer` (`getindex(::C, ::Integer)`), an implementation that only handles `Int` (`getindex(::C, ::Int)`) does **not** fulfill the contract. It is more specific than required, not more general.

This library correctly enforces the user's expectation. If you require a method signature, the implementation must match it or be more general (e.g., implement for `Any` when `Integer` is required).

So, how do you specify "this interface works for any index that is a subtype of `Integer`"? The answer is to make the index type an explicit type variable of the interface, as we did with `I<:Integer`. By passing the concrete type (`Int`) to `@assertimpls`, you are checking for that specific case.

Attempting to automatically "solve" for any possible subtype `I` is not practical:
1.  **Practicality**: It would violate the principle of least surprise, as the library would have to guess which subtypes the user cares about.
2.  **Computability**: It would require solving complex type equations at compile time, which may not even be decidable.

**Conclusion**: For flexibility in a type variable, make it an explicit type variable of the interface.

## DSL Syntax Specification

The body of an `@interface` macro supports the following requirement definitions:

```julia
@interface InterfaceName TypeComposition begin
    requirements...
end
```
where:
- `InterfaceName` is the name of the interface, a valid Julia identifier.
- `TypeComposition` is a single `TypeVariable` or a tuple of `TypeVariable`, indicating the type composition to implement the interface.
  - `TypeVariable := T[<: SuperType]` where `T` is a valid Julia name and `SuperType` is an optional valid supertype that the type must inherit from. `T` serves as a binding name that can be used as a type variable in the interface body (the block between `begin` and `end`).
- `requirements` can be several of the following:
  - `T.fieldName[::FieldType]` to specify type `T` must have a field `fieldName` of type `FieldType`.
    - `T` is a type variable declared in `TypeComposition`.
    - `fieldName` is a valid Julia identifier, the name of the field.
    - `FieldType`(Optional) either a valid Julia type or a type variable declared in `TypeComposition`. **If `FieldType` is omitted, it defaults to `Any`.**
  - `function [modulename.]name(args...[; kwargs...])[::ReturnType] end` to specify a method must be implemented for the type composition given by its signature.
    - `modulename`(Optional) is a valid Julia module name.
    - `name` is a valid Julia identifier, the name of the function.
    - `args` in either one of the following forms:
      - `argname::TypeName` to specify a positional argument `argname` of type `TypeName`. `TypeName` can be either a valid Julia type or a type variable declared in `TypeComposition`.
      - `::TypeName` to specify a positional argument of type `TypeName`.
      - `argname` to specify a positional argument of type `Any`.
    - `kwargs`(Optional) in either one of the following forms:
      - `argname[::TypeName][=default]` to specify a keyword argument `argname` of type `TypeName` with a default value `default`. `TypeName` and `default` do not take effect up to Julia 1.11.
    - `ReturnType`(Optional) either a valid Julia type or a type variable declared in `TypeComposition`. **If `ReturnType` is omitted, it defaults to `Any`.**
  - `@impls TypeComposition ParentInterfaceName` to specify that the type composition must implement the interface `ParentInterfaceName`.
    - `TypeComposition` is a tuple of concrete types or type variables declared in the interface's `TypeComposition`.
    - `ParentInterfaceName` is the name of the interface to implement.

## Keyword Arguments: A Note on Dispatch

A crucial design decision in this library is how to handle keyword arguments (kwargs). Our philosophy is to align with Julia's own method dispatch system, not to create a new, stricter one.

In Julia, `hasmethod` checks if a method exists that can be *called* with a given set of arguments. For kwargs, this has a specific consequence: a method is considered implemented even if some of its non-defaulted kwargs are not provided in the call. Julia only raises a runtime `UndefKeywordError` when the method is actually executed, not during method lookup.

For example, if an interface requires `f(x; mandatory_kw)`, an implementation `f(x; mandatory_kw, optional_kw=1)` is considered valid by `hasmethod`, and therefore by `SimpleInterfaces.jl`. Likewise, an implementation `f(x)` is considered to satisfy a requirement for `f(x; optional_kw=1)`.

**Our Guarantee**: We verify that a method signature *exists* according to Julia's dispatch rules. We do not (and cannot reliably) perform static analysis to prevent potential runtime `UndefKeywordError` or `TypeError` from misuse of kwargs.

**Recommendation**: Due to this inherent limitation in Julia's dispatch system, we advise against using keyword arguments for critical type contracts. For strict type enforcement, prefer positional arguments.

## A Note on Return Type Inference
Julia's `Base.return_types` does not always infer the narrowest possible type. If you encounter a false-negative on a return type check, please ensure your implementation of the function has an **explicit return type annotation** (e.g., `function my_func(...)::Int`). This greatly helps the type inference system and ensures your contracts are checked correctly.
